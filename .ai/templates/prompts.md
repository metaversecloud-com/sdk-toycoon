## Post-Implementation Finalization

These prompts should be used AFTER the app is implemented to clean up boilerplate and prepare for release.

### Initial Setup Prompt
```
Read through plan.md to see what to build, create an implementation plan, and ask questions before starting.
```

### Clean Up Unused Boilerplate
```
Clean up the boilerplate code by removing any unused utils, components, and types.
Trace imports from controllers and pages to identify what's actually used.
Remove unused files and update barrel exports (index.ts files).
Do NOT remove protected files (PageContainer.tsx, backendAPI.ts, etc.).
```

### Update README
```
Update the README to reflect the new app. Include:
- App name and description
- What visitors see vs. what admins see
- Key features
- API endpoints with request/response shapes
- Data object schemas
- Setup and development instructions
```

### Update Server Tests
```
Update server/tests/routes.test.ts so that it actually tests the new app's routes.
Update the SDK mock (server/mocks/@rtsdk/topia.ts) to include any new factories or methods.
Update the jest.mock("../utils/index.js") block to mock the new utils.
Add tests for each route: success, errors, auth checks, and input validation.
Remove tests for removed boilerplate routes.
```

### Commit and Open PR
```
Commit and push all changes to the dev branch, then open a PR from dev into main
with labels "release" and "major".
```

### All-in-One Finalization
```
Now that the app is implemented, please finalize it:
1. Remove all unused boilerplate code (utils, components, types) and update barrel exports
2. Update the README to describe the new app
3. Update server/tests/routes.test.ts to test the new routes (update mocks too)
4. Commit, push to dev, and open a PR into main with labels "release" and "major"
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Reference the example**: Always mention "see sdk-ai-boilerplate examples/[filename].md" so Claude knows which pattern to follow

2. **Be specific about scope**: Mention which parts you need:
   - "server utility only"
   - "full stack with UI"
   - "update existing controller"

3. **Specify the app**: Include the app path:
   - "in sdk-scavenger-hunt"
   - "in sdk-quest"
   - "in this app"

4. **Chain features**: Combine related prompts:
   ```
   Add badges with UI tabs:
   1. Server: getBadges and getVisitorBadges utilities
   2. Controller: return badges and visitorInventory
   3. Client: types, reducer, and tabbed display
   See sdk-ai-boilerplate examples/badges.md
   ```

5. **Update documentation**: After implementation, ask:
   ```
   Update sdk-ai-boilerplate documentation if this pattern is reusable across apps
   ```

6. **For multiplayer/games**: Always include locking:
   ```
   This is a multiplayer feature. Add locking to prevent race conditions.
   See sdk-ai-boilerplate examples/lockingPatterns.md
   ```

7. **For visitor feedback**: Combine interactions:
   ```
   After completing the action:
   1. Update the data object
   2. Show a toast notification
   3. Optionally close iframe or move visitor
   See sdk-ai-boilerplate examples/visitorInteractions.md
   ```
